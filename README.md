# Airboats

Airboats is a Ruby on Rails web application that helps users to book a boat to make your dreamed vacation a reality. If on the other hand you are not interested in booking a boat but offering one you own for renting, you can do that too!

## Features

- **Boat Listing**: Take a look at all the boats you can reserve offered by other people.
- **Make a reservation**: Users can select one of the boats available and make a reservation to rent it for a certain amount of time.
- **Manage your bookings**: As a user, you can manage your bookings if you have changed your mind about your reservation or unforeseen circumstances have changed your availability.
- **Create your own listing**: As a user, if you have your own boat and wish to create a new listing, you can make it available for the rest of users.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user accounts and authentication system.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on various devices and screen sizes.

## Usage

1. Sign up or log in to your account.
2. Explore the app and browse all the available offerings.
3. Bbook your chosen boat after making your decision.
4. Manage your booking.
